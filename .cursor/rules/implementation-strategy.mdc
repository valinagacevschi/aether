# Implementation Strategy

**"Python for infrastructure, idiomatic SDKs for developers"**
- **Relay:** Python (asyncio-native, debuggable by ML engineers)
- **Python SDK:** Native Python (shares codebase with relay)
- **TypeScript SDK:** Native TypeScript with WASM crypto bundle

This ensures `pip install` and `npm install` work immediately while maintaining debuggability and ecosystem alignment.

## Cross-Language Feature Parity

When adding features, ensure both Python and TypeScript SDKs are updated (or document why only one is needed).
