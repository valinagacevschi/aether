# Git Workflow Guidelines

## Commit Messages

Git history shows short, sentence-case summaries (e.g., "Add initial implementation…"). Use the same style:
- Imperative, present tense, no trailing period.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should include:
- A short summary of changes and motivation.
- References to relevant issues, PRD sections, or RFC sections.
- Notes on tests run (or why not applicable).
- For protocol changes, update `RFC.txt`, `PRD.md`, and relevant docs.
- Ensure conformance tests pass (Python relay, Python SDK, TypeScript SDK all pass test vectors).
