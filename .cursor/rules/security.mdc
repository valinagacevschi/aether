# Security Guidelines

## Cryptographic Libraries

Use only established cryptographic libraries:
- Python: PyNaCl (Ed25519), blake3
- TypeScript: @noble/ed25519 or tweetnacl, blake3 (WASM)

## Security-Sensitive Changes

Security-sensitive changes (crypto, signing, identity) must include rationale and tests.

## Secrets Management

Do not commit secrets or keys.
