# Conformance & Interoperability

## Shared Test Vectors

All implementations must pass 100% of test vectors from `spec/test-vectors/`.

## Interoperability

Weekly "plug-fest" testing ensures Python client ↔ Python relay ↔ TypeScript client work together.

## CI/CD

All implementations are tested against the same test vectors in CI.
