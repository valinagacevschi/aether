2026-02-02: Completed JD-001 by adding spec/protocol.md (sections for Event Structure, Event Kinds, Tag Filtering, Transport, Validation + field limits). pnpm typecheck and pnpm test failed: no package.json in repo root.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-002 by adding spec/schema.fbs (FlatBuffers Event/Tag with fixed-size byte vectors). pnpm typecheck/test failed: no package.json in repo root. Next: JD-003 valid vectors.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-003 by adding spec/test-vectors/valid-events.yaml with 3 valid events (empty tags, UTF-8 content). pnpm typecheck/test failed: no package.json in repo root.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-004 by adding spec/test-vectors/invalid-events.yaml (bad signature, mismatched event_id, out-of-range kind). pnpm typecheck/test will still fail in repo root: no package.json.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-005 by scaffolding implementations/relay/pyproject.toml and aether_relay package (__init__.py, server.py stub). pnpm typecheck/test failed: no package.json in repo root. Next: JD-006 Python crypto utilities.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-006 by adding aether_relay/crypto.py (Blake3 event_id, Ed25519 keygen/sign/verify, tag normalization) plus pytest coverage for vectors and signing. Added PyNaCl + blake3 deps and dev deps (pytest, PyYAML, black, ruff, mypy). Next: JD-007 validation logic. pnpm typecheck/test still fail: no package.json in repo root.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-007 by adding aether_relay/validation.py (event_id match, signature verify, kind range 0-39999, timestamp window) plus tests for vectors and failure cases; added types-PyYAML dev dep and typing tweaks to satisfy mypy. pytest and mypy pass in /tmp/aether-relay-venv. pnpm typecheck/test fail at repo root: no package.json.
