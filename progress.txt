2026-02-02: Completed JD-001 by adding spec/protocol.md (sections for Event Structure, Event Kinds, Tag Filtering, Transport, Validation + field limits). pnpm typecheck and pnpm test failed: no package.json in repo root.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-002 by adding spec/schema.fbs (FlatBuffers Event/Tag with fixed-size byte vectors). pnpm typecheck/test failed: no package.json in repo root. Next: JD-003 valid vectors.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-003 by adding spec/test-vectors/valid-events.yaml with 3 valid events (empty tags, UTF-8 content). pnpm typecheck/test failed: no package.json in repo root.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-004 by adding spec/test-vectors/invalid-events.yaml (bad signature, mismatched event_id, out-of-range kind). pnpm typecheck/test will still fail in repo root: no package.json.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-005 by scaffolding implementations/relay/pyproject.toml and aether_relay package (__init__.py, server.py stub). pnpm typecheck/test failed: no package.json in repo root. Next: JD-006 Python crypto utilities.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-006 by adding aether_relay/crypto.py (Blake3 event_id, Ed25519 keygen/sign/verify, tag normalization) plus pytest coverage for vectors and signing. Added PyNaCl + blake3 deps and dev deps (pytest, PyYAML, black, ruff, mypy). Next: JD-007 validation logic. pnpm typecheck/test still fail: no package.json in repo root.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-007 by adding aether_relay/validation.py (event_id match, signature verify, kind range 0-39999, timestamp window) plus tests for vectors and failure cases; added types-PyYAML dev dep and typing tweaks to satisfy mypy. pytest and mypy pass in /tmp/aether-relay-venv. pnpm typecheck/test fail at repo root: no package.json.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-008 by adding in-memory storage (immutable/replaceable/ephemeral/parameterized semantics), query filtering, and tests. pytest not available in PATH (command not found). pnpm typecheck/test fail: no package.json in repo root.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-011 by adding implementations/relay/tests/test_vectors.py conformance runner for valid/invalid vectors (event_id/signature/kind). pnpm typecheck/test fail: no package.json in repo root. python -m pytest and mypy failed: modules not installed.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-009 by scaffolding implementations/python-sdk (pyproject.toml, aether package, Client stub). Checks: pnpm typecheck/test failed (no package.json in repo root). python -m pytest failed (pytest not installed). python -m mypy . failed (mypy not installed).
2026-02-02: Completed JD-010 by scaffolding implementations/typescript-sdk (package.json, tsconfig.json, src/client.ts stub with connect/publish). pnpm typecheck/test still fail at repo root: no package.json.
2026-02-02: Completed JD-012 by adding aether/crdt helpers (GCounter, PNCounter, LWWRegister, ORSet) with minimal merge semantics and tests. pnpm typecheck/test fail at repo root: no package.json. pytest/mypy not available in PATH in implementations/python-sdk.
2026-02-02: Fixed mypy typing in in-memory store (separate replaceable/parameterized keys) and added root package.json + TS pnpm-lock so pnpm typecheck/test run. pnpm typecheck/test pass with PATH=/tmp/aether-venv/bin:$PATH.
